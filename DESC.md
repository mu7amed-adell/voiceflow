🚀 Deployment Instructions
Quick Start

# 1. Build the image
./scripts/docker-build.sh

# 2. Run the container
./scripts/docker-run.sh

# 3. Or use Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
Production Deployment

# Build for production
./scripts/docker-build.sh v1.0.0

# Deploy with compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
